        <hr>
        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>
					Hi there! I am a California-based computer science student at UC Irvine with
					a passion for creating! I have always loved to make things that help or
					entertain others, meaning that I have had a lot of time to expose myself
					to a number of creative tools, mediums, and practices. On this site, you
					can find a few examples of my work, read about some of my career
					experiences, and find some information on where to find me!
				</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This summer I served as a STEP intern at Google, where I worked with Google engineers and other interns to create interactive web applications and grow my software engineering skills.</li>
					<li>Last summer I was 1 of 30 high school students chosen to attend Google's CSSI program at their Mountain View campus.</li>
					<li>I've created videos and graphics for livestreamers which have drawn millions of views.</li>
        </ul>

            During my Google STEP internship,  I worked with 2 other interns to
            create an interactive webapp called Centralize, which allows users
            to easily find and post resources for contribuiting to important
            causes. I personally implemented user authentication, several front
            end and user experience aspects, as well as a community voting
            system and algorithm which served as components of several other
            features.

            Using a combination of several technologies I am creating an
            interactive portfolio site as one of my Google STEP Intern starter
            projects. In addition to various accessibility considerations, the
            original site included a comment section that demonstrated
            interacting with a back-end to create, read, and delete data on the
            site.

            Highlight Helper is a project I am currently working on which serves
            as a way to track notable moments during an event, livestream, or
            recording session. The app does so by allowing users to easily
            identify spans of time using nested timers. I plan to allow users to
            export these time intervals to CSV files and would like to
            incorporate the Twitch API in order to allow them to automatically
            download these video segments.

            now-playing-element was a project which utilized the Last.fm API in

            a dynamic visual which credits musicians in realtime.
